<h2 align="centre">Regression - Experimenting with additional models</h2>

In the previous notebook, we used simple regression models to look at the relationship between features of a bike 
rentals dataset. 

## Experiment with Algorithms

The linear regression algorithm we used last time to train the model has some predictive capability, but there are many kinds of regression algorithm we could try, including:

- **Linear algorithms**: Not just the Linear Regression algorithm we used above (which is technically an *Ordinary Least Squares* algorithm), but other variants such as *Lasso* and *Ridge*.
- **Tree-based algorithms**: Algorithms that build a decision tree to reach a prediction.
- **Ensemble algorithms**: Algorithms that combine the outputs of multiple base algorithms to improve generalizability.

> **Note**: For a full list of Scikit-Learn estimators that encapsulate algorithms for supervised machine learning, see the [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html). There are many algorithms to choose from, but for most real-world scenarios, the [Scikit-Learn estimator cheat sheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) can help you find a suitable starting point.
